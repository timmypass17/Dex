#  Dex - Pokemon Card Collection App

A card collection app that allows users to store their pokemon card collection onto their devices. Allows users to look up specific cards, entire sets, prices, track set completion, and other additional information.

Dex uses the [Pok√©mon TCG API](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/) and follows the [MVVM architecture pattern](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) & [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to cache and make network requests.

  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
